Module 1: 

 

Introduction to iOS 11, Xcode 9 and Swift 4 (1:21:58) 

Lecture 1 Slides (9 pg) 

Read 1: Intro to Swift (7 pg)




Reading assignment spans two weeks due to amount of reading materials listed in the 7-pg doc "Read 1: Intro to Swift" per course professor. Currently the readings contain the basics of Swift and its components relative to objective-C as well as facets that were improved upon by Swift such as advanced types like tuples. Course video and slides introduce students to the basic layers of an iOS application. The (4) layers consist of, from a top-down perspective, Cocoa Touch, Media, Core Services, and Core OS. Cocoa Touch is the general UI, image picker, map kit, and view hierarchy control. Media includes all media extensions for core audio, JPG, PDF, core animation. Core Services include SQLite, networking, collections and media. Finally, the core OS is as close to the hardware we can get. Includes the OSX kernel, security, Mach 3.0 file system, and power management. Based mostly in UNIX and written in C, but as a class we will only be discussing the core services layer and the Cocoa Touch layer. The main focus of the application development will be to implement a game called "Concentration" in the Xcode environment. The rest of lecture includes demoing the Xcode environment.
